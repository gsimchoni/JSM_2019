# Line 'Em Up!

Does your plot contain a signal over noise?
========================================================
incremental: true

- The key to understanding Visual Inference:
- A plot is a statistic
- Permute your data a few times, gather a few plots
- Judge your plot vs. the distribution of plots
- Assumption-free, Parameter-free
- But how to present a distribution of plots?

Like so...
========================================================

### Is there a relation between a car's Displacement and its Horse Power?

<div class="footer">bit.ly/jsm2019</div>

And so...
========================================================

### Is there a relation between Gender and Answer?
#### (Is it rude to bring a baby on plane?)

And so...
========================================================

### Is there a relation between an actor's gender and no. of roles since his/her character ended?

But wait

# But wait, did you just say "judge a plot", as in "classify an image", and the year >= 2012?

========================================================
title: FALSE

# Me Against My Laptop

How many scatterplots have I looked at?
========================================================
incremental: true

- Scatterplots, Residual plots, Pairs plots
- Say 3 plots a day (as if) X 5 days a week X 52 weeks a year X 9 years since graduation = 7K
- Well, my laptop can look at 20K scatterplots in 1 minute
- Is my laptop a better Statistician than me? No.
- *Could* my laptop be a better Statistician than me?
